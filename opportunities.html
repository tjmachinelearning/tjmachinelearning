         <h3>Cold Emailing</h3>
         <p>Cold emailing is the process of sending out emails to many professors reaching out for opportunities to research and be mentored under them. Here are some tips to be successful.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Research the work/publications of each professor you are cold emailing

                <ul>
                   <li><p>Makes the email more personal and more relevant to the professor, and they can understand in exactly what ways you can contribute/help their current research. 
                </p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Don't procrastinate
                <ul>
                   <li>Prepare a list of professors and your resume during winter break
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>The resume should be one page and clear and concise

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Don't be disheartened if you don't get a response

                <ul>
                   <li><p>Professors are very busy, and generally high school students receive one response for every 50 cold emails they send. 
                </p></li>
                   <li><p>They may also take months to respond
                </p></li>

                </p></li>
                   <li>Talk about their research, and ideas and questions you have about it (You should be genuinely interested in their research)

                        <ul>
                            <li><p>You could also talk about an idea you have that would be a good fit in their lab to further research/develop.
                            </p></li>
                        </ul>

         <h3>Resume Tips</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Find a Resume/CV template on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv">Overleaf</a> or on Microsoft Word
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Overleaf requires editing in LateX, but is generally better for making resumes and easier to format once you learn LateX                    </p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Minimize white space
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Helps make the resume look more professional and has more content that is actually useful                    </p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>Make sure the resume has Skills, Experience, Education, and Project sections and optionally an Awards section.            </p></li>
            <li><p>Make your resume relevant to what you are applying to            </p></li>
            <li><p>Generally 1 page resumes are better, as they are more readable and easier to skim through, however two pagers are useful in certain scenarios that require you to be more in depth about your experience.             </p></li>
