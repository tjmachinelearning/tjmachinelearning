        <h3>Random Forests Competition Instructions</h3>
        <h4>The Data</h4>
        <p><i>9/20/17 -&emsp;</i>Your job is to write the code to create a decision tree, train it on the training data, and use it to predict the classes of the testing data.
        We are trying to classify survival of passengers on the Titanic. The data we are using are from actual passengers on the ship.
        Your decision tree is supposed to classify whether a passenger survived (RIP (0) or Survived (1)), based on 7 different metrics (features).
        The training data looks like this: </p>
        <p>
        <code>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, survival<br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, survival<br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, survival<br>
        etc. (501 lines) <br></code>
        </p>
        <p>
        and the testing data looks like this: </p>
        <p>
        <code>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7<br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7<br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7<br>
        etc. (214 lines) <br>
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>
        Your end goal is to create a file which looks like: <br>
        <code>
        id, solution <br>
        1, predicted_class <br>
        2, predicted_class <br>
        3, predicted_class <br>
        4, predicted_class <br>
        etc. (214 lines) <br>
        </code>

        For every set of features in line N in the training data, you should have a line <code>N, predicted_class</code> in your submission file.
        </p>
        <p> In case you care, the features correspond to: </p>
        <code>
            pclass - Ticket class: 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd </br>
            sex	- Sex: 0 = Male, 1 = Female <br>
            Age - Age in years	<br>
            sibsp - # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	<br>
            parch - # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	<br>
            fare - passenger fare <br>
            embarked - Port of Embarkation: 0 = Southampton, 1 = Cherbourg, 2 = Queenstown<br>
            survival - Survival: 0 = No, 1 = Yes<br>
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>Shell code is available on the <a href="schedule.html">lecture schedule page</a>.
            The Data I/O code from the decision tree lecture will still be useful, but will need to be adapted for this data.
        </p>
        <h3>2017-2018 First Competition Instructions</h3>
        <h4>The Data</h4>
        <p><i>9/20/17 -&emsp;</i>Welcome to the first contest of the year! Your job is to write the code to create a decision tree, train it on the training data, and use it to predict the classes of the testing data.
        We are trying to classify breast cancer data. The data we are using is actual data from breast cancer patients.
        Your decision tree is supposed to classify the type of breast cancer they have (benign (0) or malignant (1)), based on 9 different metrics (features).
        The training data looks like this: </p>
        <p>
        <code>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9, class <br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9, class <br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9, class <br>
        etc. (533 lines) <br></code>
        </p>
        <p>
        and the testing data looks like this: </p>
        <p>
        <code>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9 <br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9 <br>
        feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, feature 4, feature 5, feature 6, feature 7, feature 8, feature 9 <br>
        etc. (150 lines) <br>
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>
        Your end goal is to create a file which looks like: <br>
        <code>
        id, solution <br>
        1, predicted_class <br>
        2, predicted_class <br>
        3, predicted_class <br>
        4, predicted_class <br>
        etc. (150 lines) <br>
        </code>

        For every set of features in line N in the training data, you should have a line <code>N, predicted_class</code> in your submission file. </p>

        <h4>How to participate</h4>
        <p>
        	Our contests will be held on <a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>, using <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com">Kaggle InClass</a>. This allows us to upload data and competition instructions, as well as impose submission deadlines. It also ranks submissions automatically!

        	To participate:</p>
        <p>
        <ol><li>Create a Kaggle account by clicking "sign up" in the top right.
        </li><li>Click on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/t/cb7c483774b8408582fd138a3a49b0d4">this link</a> (the competition link).
        </li><li>Download the training and testing data.
        </li><li>Download the I/O Code.
        </li><li>Write your algorithm and train it on the training data.
        </li><li>Then, test it on the testing data, creating a submission file with the predicted ground truth in the format shown in the sample submission file.
        </li><li>Upload your submission file and see your results!
        </li><li>Tweak your code, repeating steps 5-8 to improve your accuracy and move up the leaderboard.
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        Some More Rules:
        <ol>
        <li>Use Python. Everything we do is in Python this year. Don't use a library, other than numpy. For this contest only, if you have no Python experience, you can use whatever language you are comfortable with.
        </li><li>The Competition ends at 11:59:00 PM next Monday, 9/25.
        </li><li>The leaderboard on Kaggle that you can see is the Public Leaderboard, which is your accuracy for 50% of the testing data. Your final rankings will be based on the Private leaderboard, which is based on the other 50% of the testing data and will become public as soon as the competition ends. This is to prevent you from just writing a decision tree that overfits the testing data, which defeats the purpose.
        </li></ol>
        </p>

        <h3>
            Code Submission
        </h3>
            <p><i>7/1/17 -&emsp;</i>Last year, we used <a href="https://www.dropitto.me">dropitto.me</a> as a simple way of submitting your code for grading. Since the service shut down this summer, we
                are currently working on finding a replacement. We'll update this page before competitions start in October.
		 As of now, we are planning on setting up a Kaggle classroom.
		  Kaggle provides a seamless interface for creating competitions, posting data, and grading submissions.
		   More information can be found on <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/">Kaggle's website</a>.</p>

        </h3>
            <p><i>6/21/17 -&emsp;</i>The year is finally over! We've got two months of summer ahead of us, but your ML Club officers already have a few plans for September.
		First and foremost, we plan on expanding into a second room so that everyone can come. </p>
            <p>Secondly, we will split into two groups. This will allow the club to cover complex topics with advanced members while not alienating newcomers.
		Higher-level lectures with less mathematical rigor will be given to Freshmen/Sophmores in APCS with little Python or AI experience.
		    These lectures will be similar to this past year's, covering standard ML algorithms and the basics of Deep Learning.
		    For those already familiar with machine learning, we're making new, rigorous lectures, covering topics from object detection to language translation and combating networks.
		</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we're formalizing our mentoring initiative.
	We've already helped a variety of projects off the books, but the ever-growing popularity of machine learning as a research tool allows us to make this a permanent part of the club.
	Look for forms in September.
	    </p>
	<p>
	Finally, our website will undergo heavy renovation as we upgrade all of the lectures.
	We look forward to seeing everyone in the fall!</p>
