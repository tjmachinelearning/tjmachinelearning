        <p> Machine Learning Club proudly supports ML research at TJ. We encourage our members to apply the knowledge they've gained from
        the lectures and competitions to real-world data: from biology to computer security, the applications are endless!</p>

            <h4>EEG-Controlled Exoskeleton</h4>
            <p><i>Nithin Dass, Yash Bollisetty, and Srinidhi Krishnamurthy</i></p>
            <p>Modern exoskeletons cost thousands of dollars and are far too expensive for the majority of the paralyzed population.
              Nithin and his friends set out to create an inexpensive exoskeleton that a paralyzed patient could control with their brain, and they turned to machine learning to classify EEG signals.
              Using a Discrete Wavelength Transform to convert EEG signals into vectors, they then used a support vector machine to differentiate the EEG signals into two classes of motion.

        <h4>
            Diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy
        </h4>
            <p><i>Justin Zhang, Kavya Kopparapu, Neeyanth Kopparapu</i></p>
            <p>
              When Justin was tasked with diagnosing diabetic retinopathy using nothing more than tens of thousands of images, he turned to machine learning.
              Using his knowledge from the club and beyond, he employed transfer learning. Using only a ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet
              and fine-tuning the last layers, his results were astounding - until Google beat them soundly.

        <h4>
            Some Project Goes Here
        </h4>
         <p><i>Yuki Oyama</i></p>
         <p>The project description will go here. this is currently filler, but it won't be soon, once the information is up here.
         This project used Scikit-Learn, rather than Tensorflow or Keras or PyTorch, partially because there was no deep learning involved.
         </p>

        <h4>
            Detecting Terrorism on Social Media
        </h4>
          <p><i>Mihir Patel and Nikhil Sardana</i></p>
          <p>When Mihir and Nikhil saw the numerous terrorist accounts on social media, they realized that they could use the logos and flags of the extremists against them.
          They used computer vision techniques to crop around the flag and a convolutional neural network to learn the patterns of the logo.
          They combined this image detection with caption analysis and user statistics, and a support vector machine learned which features were most important for classifying terrorist accounts.
