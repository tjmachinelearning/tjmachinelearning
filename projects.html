        <p>Machine Learning Club proudly supports ML research at TJ. We encourage our members to apply the knowledge they've gained from
        the lectures and competitions to real-world data: from biology to computer security, the applications are endless!</p>
        <h3>Research@TJML</h3>
		<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLhN71nifhGZC0DtAU6c2i5rZcLRDs5DSgBrKbqv3H52TEIw/viewform#responses">Sign up form</a>. Signups close 2/28/2018.</p>
	    	<p>Research@TJML is founded on four principles:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Providing underclassmen with mentors experienced with research competitions and ML.</li>
			<li>Reducing the number of trivial ML projects (e.g. applying an existing model to a specific dataset and improving accuracy minimally)</li>
			<li>Providing flexibility for ML applications across fields while encouraging theoretical ML projects</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you would like more information, the introductory presentation given on 1/3/2017 is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hzMjoAFyGnq1IyEdLcn9dj__biu7Fdyc92hcwp9cI2o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Note that the form will ask you if you are interested in ML Applications or Theoretical ML</p>
		<h4>ML Applications</h4>
			<p><Projects for which the main innovation takes place in the other scientific field. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A computational biology project where the novel part is in the biology field</li>
				<li>A robotics project where the robotics part is the hard part</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you select ML Applications, you won't have a mentor (since we don't have expertise in your other scientific field). If you are doing ML applications, partnering up with someone in your other scientific field (e.g. bio, robo, etc.) is allowed/encouraged. You will still be able to present in late May and will be able to ask the officers if you need help sporadically.
			It is important for ML Applications projects that the ML is simply a tool for your novel bio/chem/robo/etc. research. Using a complex CNN isn't necessary or better in any way if a simple Random Forest gets the job done.</p>
		<h4>Theoretical ML</h4>
			<p>Projects for which the innovation is in ML itself. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A heavily modified network that beats a current benchmark</li>
				<li>Modifying a new type of network to work on a problem traditionally solved using an older type of network</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your ML project will have multiple applications reach into other fields, but your project won't actually address these applications. For example, faster image recognition is useful for video surveillance, but you won't be building a video surveillance system. If you choose theoretical ML, your project will have a mentor and you will go through the process outlined in the presentation on 1/3/2017.</p>

	<p>Here are a brief sample of the many projects, both completed and ongoing, we have helped mentor.</p>
	<h4>
            Retinal Image Segmentation
        </h4>
            <p><i>Nithin Dass</i></p>
            <p>
            	Retinal image analysis has many applications, from checking the health of the eye to using it as indicators for other more severe diseases.
		In order to provide valuable insights to eye-doctors as well as those looking for symptons in eyes, this project aims to automatically segment retinal images.
		Several important features will be filtered out, such as blood vessels, which can be fed into more complex, application specific machine learning structures.
            </p>

	    <h4>EEG-Controlled Exoskeleton</h4>
            <p><i>Nithin Dass, Yash Bollisetty, and Srinidhi Krishnamurthy</i></p>
            <p>Modern exoskeletons cost thousands of dollars and are far too expensive for the majority of the paralyzed population.
              This project set out to create an inexpensive exoskeleton that a paralyzed patient could control with their brain, and they turned to machine learning to classify EEG signals.
              Using a Discrete Wavelength Transform to convert EEG signals into vectors, they then used a support vector machine to differentiate the EEG signals into two classes of motion.
              This allowed for a basic exoskeleton to allow for upperbody movement and body stabilization.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy
        </h4>
            <p><i>Justin Zhang, Kavya Kopparapu, Neeyanth Kopparapu</i></p>
            <p>
              Blindness related to diabetes, formally known as diabetic retinopathy, is a common condition in poor regions where difficult access to medical care prevents diagnosis.
              After this project, all you need to diagnose diabetic retinopathy is a smartphone, an inexpensive lens system, and a convolutional neural network trained on tens of thousands of images.
              Justin used Keras to create the deep learning model, taking advantage of the power of transfer learning with ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. The end result: the project almost worked.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Automating Plagarism Detection
        </h4>
            <p><i>Yuki Oyama, Arvind Srinivasan</i></p>
            <p>
            	Detecting certain characteristics of writing related to style is very difficult using traditional methods.
		However, using machine learning, this project was able to associate authors with 72 different linguistic parameters characterizing writing style.
		They turned to Scikit-Learn for a quick and fast network which yielded impressive results.
		This apporach can be used as an improved way for preventing plagarism versus traditional methods.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Detecting Terrorism on Social Media
        </h4>
          <p><i>Mihir Patel and Nikhil Sardana</i></p>
          <p>Many extremists such as ISIS have used social media to recruit and influence thousands of potential jihadists and foreign fighters.
          TerroristTracker aims to stop this form of propaganda by turning the techniques these organizations use against them.
          By following specific symbols, such as the ISIS flag, using computer vision techniques and convolutional neural networks, a new system has been developed to track image features with 93.5% accuracy.
          These features, along with those extracted from caption analysis and user content, has allowed for classification with an SVM with 90.5% accuracy for identifying terrorist accounts.
          </p>
