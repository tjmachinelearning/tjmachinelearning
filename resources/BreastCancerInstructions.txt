Your goal is to obtain the highest accuracy

A rew rules:
- All programs must be python3
- Use Scikit-learn to make your life not impossible
- Submit your code by the end of the week

Hints: 
- Start by modifying the sample code if you're stuck
- Graphing can potentially help determine the ideal kernel (potentially)
- If you're ambitious, graphing and writing custom kernels is the way to go
