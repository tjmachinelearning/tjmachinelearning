        	<h3>Technical Resources</h3>
         <p>These are resources to consult if you're looking to supplement knowledge gained from club lectures.</p>

         <ul>




            <li>Coursera Courses
               <ul>
                  <li><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?">Machine Learning</a>: This is a great course to get started with Machine Learning. You'll familiarize yourself with terminology and learn about traditional ML models. (The exercises are in a language called MATLAB, but this is not usually used nowadays for ML applications. It may be worth doing the exercises in Python, or just watching the videos.)</p></li>
                  <li><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?">deeplearning.ai</a>: This five course series is a great way to learn about neural networks and deep learning. You'll learn about neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks. It will also give you hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks such as Keras and TensorFlow. Although it requires money to access the exercises and quizzes, you can audit the course and have access to the lectures. This course is great if you do not yet have a strong understanding of math concepts such as gradients and partial derivative because the instructor teaches them along the way.</p></li>
                  <li><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning?">Reinforcement Learning Specialization</a>: This series of courses by the University of Alberta teaches you about reinforcement learning. You can audit the courses and have access to all the quizzes and videos.</p></li>
               </ul>
            </li>


         <li>Online University Courses
            <p>We recommend reading the lecture notes or watching the videos of the <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/">CS229</a> and <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">CS231n</a> courses.
               CS229 takes a more mathematical look at standard machine learning methods, while CS231n focuses on deep learning algorithms for visual processing. The rigorous <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/">lecture notes</a> for CS229 are especially helpful.</p>
             <p>If you're interested in reinforcement learning, we recommend viewing the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html">CS234</a> course notes, slides, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u">videos</a>. If you want to learn more about generative models,
               slides and <a href="https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/notes/index.html">notes</a> are available from the <a href="https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/">CS236</a> course, but no lecture recordings are available. Other interesting courses include <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS224n</a>, which covers natural language processing, <a href="https://cs228.stanford.edu/">CS228</a>: Probabilistic Graphical Models,
               and <a href="https://cs330.stanford.edu/">CS330</a>: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning.
               </p>
               <p>
                   If some materials are unavailable because a course is currently in session, look for archived versions of previous offerings. Most courses should also have lecture videos from a previous year publicly available on YouTube.
               </p>
         </li>

         <h3>Nontechnical Resources</h3>
         <p>Here are some resources if you are interested in learning more about the field of AI in a nontechnical manner:</p>
         <ul>
                  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4">Artificial Intelligence Podcast</a>: Created by Lex Fridman, a researcher in human-centered AI and deep learning at MIT, this podcast contains discussions

            <h3>Computational Resources</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, TJ has a severe lack of GPUs. When the Computer Systems lab was upgraded a few years ago, the aging CPUs were replaced with then-modern i5-4690s. However, the GPUs remain GT 730s.
                If you would like to run your code on TJ machines, we recommend you use the computer called <code>zoidberg</code>, which has modern GPUs. Simply ssh using the following commands:
            <br><code>ssh username@remote.tjhsst.edu<br>
                     ssh zoidberg
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>All current students can access TJ syslab machines through ssh. Follow <a href="res/guides/ssh.txt">these instructions</a>. If you would like to transfer data to the high performance computing cluster, take a look at <a href="res/guides/datatransfer.txt">this guide</a>.
            <h3>
      <a id="welcome-to-tjhsst-machine-learning" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-tjhsst-machine-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing Libraries on TJ Linux Machines</h3>

            <p>
            All the necessary dependencies (CUDA, cuDNN) have been installed for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://keras.io">Keras</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a> on the Linux machines.
            Assuming the library you want hasn't already been installed, you'll need to install it with the <code>--user</code> flag. Use these commands on machines with GPUs for TensorFlow and Keras, respectively:
            <br>
            <code>
                     pip3 install tensorflow-gpu --user
                     <br>pip3 install keras --user
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Keras requires a backend engine (TensorFlow is recommended).
        </p>
        <p>
             For PyTorch, check the latest commands on <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">the website</a>. Select the proper Python and CUDA versions. You can check your python version by typing <code>python</code> and the CUDA version with <code>nvcc --version</code>.
    	 </p>
    	 <p>
    	    If you are working on a standard Linux machine without a decent GPU, you'll need to install the CPU versions of these libraries.
    	    For TensorFlow, installation instructions are available <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install">here</a>. For Pytorch, ensure you select "None" for the CUDA version.
    	    As always, you will need to add <code> --user</code> to all commands if you aren't working in a virtual environment, or don't have root.
    	 </p>
    	    <h3>Installing Libraries on Your Own Linux Machine</h3>
            <p>If you want to install these libraries on your own Linux computer, just remove the <code>--user</code> for the above commands, since you presumably have root.
                If you don't have a half-decent Nvidia GPU, running large deep learning models will take unreasonably long, and it is advisable you use the TJ GPU cluster. If you do have a GPU, make sure you have <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html">CUDA</a> and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html">cuDNN</a> configured beforehand.
    	</p>
        <h3>Libraries on Windows Machines</h3>
          <p>Most machine learning libraries are compatible with Windows, especially CPU versions. GPU-dependent deep learning libraries are often slower and less reliable on Windows, so use Linux if you can.
          <p>Machine Learning Club recommends using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">scikit-learn</a> for simple machine learning. You can install it using:
              <br>
              <code>
                  pip3 install -U scikit-learn
              </code>
          </p>
          <p>If you are trying to run on TJ Windows machines, a bit of a workaround is required due to restrictions. Follow these instructions for scikit-learn.</p>
          <p><a href= "res/install/scikit_tj_windows.txt">Instructions for installing scikit-learn on TJHSST Windows Machines</a></p>
          <p>If you can't get that to work, use our <a href = "res/guides/ssh.txt">Instructions for ssh'ing into the syslab</a></p>
          <p><a href = "res/guides/vimandnano.txt">Basic Vim and Nano Instructions</a></p>
          <h3>Python 2 or 3?</h3>
          <p>Machine Learning Club recommends Python 3 whenever possible. Almost all libraries have support for the latest version.
          Even though most support Python 2.7 as well, Python 2 support ends in <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">2020</a>, so make the switch if you haven't already!</p>
