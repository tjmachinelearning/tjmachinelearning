                PANDwriting is a novel system for diagnostic assessment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) using
                handwriting kinematic analysis, particularly targeted to increase Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnostic access in lower-income areas and resource-poor health systems. An
                ensemble classifier consisting of a neural network, support vector machine, and random forest was
                trained with 10-fold cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of 74% in distinguishing PD
                patients from healthy controls (n=75).

                Over 1.3 million people are killed each year in road traffic crashes worldwide. Autonomous vehicles are
                the future of transportation. We devised an autonomous system for navigating highways using multi-agent
                reinforcement learning (MARL) using a shared intelligence system, allowing each agent (in this case the
                vehicles) to avoid collisions and efficiently move through traffic. We tested our algorithm first on a
                simulator, then generalized it to the real world where we trained our agent on varying parameters using
                a technique called active domain randomization.

                Current devices geared towards the deaf and hard of hearing, such as hearing aids, struggle to localize
                and transmit sounds to those with severe hearing impairments. Our goal was to convey the
                directionality, pitch, amplitude, sound classification, and speech recognition of multiple sound sources
                to those with hearing impairments through a low-cost device. We localized sounds with the SRP-PHAT-HSDA
                algorithm calculated on incoming audio captured by a 6-microphone array. We classified
                each source in real-time using a stacked generalization ensemble trained on an augmented audio dataset.

                There are over 289 million people with visual disabilities worldwide and that number is expected to grow
                to 579 million in only 3 decades. Current techniques to aid the visually disabled are expensive and
                limited in their ability, with limited and low accuracy computer vision. With ensemble learning we were
                able to get accuracies as high as 88% with four CV architectures trained on COCO and OIDv4. Furthermore,
                with an inexpensive camera-vibration interface, combined with an app, we were able effectively guide a
                user to a designated object in real-time using several onboard microcontrollers.

                Cardiovascular disease (CD) is the number one leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for more than
                17 million deaths in 2015. Based on a simple interface and machine learning, HeartFit allows users to
                administer diagnoses themselves. The model consists of a deep recurrent convolutional neural network
                trained on 132 pre-labeled heartbeat audio samples. After the model was validated on a previously unseen
                set of 44 heartbeat audio samples, it achieved an f-beta score of 0.93 and an accuracy of 93.1%. This
                value exceeds that of clinical examination accuracy, which is around 83%, demonstrating the
                effectiveness of the HeartFit platform.

                The purpose of this parametric study is to improve upon the US Navy's
                ability to detect illegal ships. Building on Dr. Hoffman's work, Neal, along with Dr. Colin Olsen and
                Dr. Timothy Doster,
                propose methods using kPCA, which outperforms current RX methods.
                In addition, he constructs an object-level analysis of anomaly detection performance, which is more
                intuitive and representative of the success in identifying ships rather than
                the contemporary pixel-level analysis. This research was originally conducted at a naval research lab,
                and Neal continued his work under the guidance of TJML.

                Min explored a possible use of breast cancer classification models as a prediction tool in clinical
                settings. This empirical research had three phases: discriminating tumor type, classifying recurrence
                outcome within 1, 2, 3, and 5 years after surgery, and creating a predictive application with Java. The
                SMO models classified tumor types with 98% accuracy and recurrence outcomes with 91%, 83%, 78%, and 69%
                accuracy within 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Lastly, a Java application implementing the SMO
                models was created to predict recurrence outcome for each year’s end with a specific data input.

                Retinal image analysis has many applications, from checking the health of the eye to using it as

                In order to provide valuable insights to eye doctors as well as those looking for symptons in eyes, this
                project aims to automatically segment retinal images.
                Several important features will be filtered out, such as blood vessels, which can be fed into more

            <p>Modern exoskeletons cost thousands of dollars and are far too expensive for the majority of the paralyzed
                population.
                This project set out to create an inexpensive exoskeleton that a paralyzed patient could control with
                their brain, and they turned to machine learning to classify EEG signals.
                Using a Discrete Wavelength Transform to convert EEG signals into vectors, they then used a support
                vector machine to differentiate the EEG signals into two classes of motion.
                This allowed for a basic exoskeleton to allow for upperbody movement and body stabilization.

                Blindness related to diabetes, formally known as diabetic retinopathy, is a common condition in poor
                regions where difficult access to medical care prevents diagnosis.
                After this project, all you need to diagnose diabetic retinopathy is a smartphone, an inexpensive lens
                system, and a convolutional neural network trained on tens of thousands of images.
                Justin used Keras to create the deep learning model, taking advantage of the power of transfer learning
                with ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet.

                Detecting certain characteristics of writing related to style is very difficult using traditional
                methods.
                However, using machine learning, this project was able to associate authors with 72 different linguistic
                parameters characterizing writing style.
                They turned to Scikit-Learn for a quick and fast network which yielded impressive results.

            <p>Many extremists such as ISIS have used social media to recruit and influence thousands of potential
                jihadists and foreign fighters.
                TerroristTracker aims to stop this form of propaganda by turning the techniques these organizations use
                against them.
                By following specific symbols, such as the ISIS flag, using computer vision techniques and convolutional
                neural networks, a new system has been developed to track image features with 93.5% accuracy.
                These features, along with those extracted from caption analysis and user content, has allowed for
                classification with an SVM with 90.5% accuracy for identifying terrorist accounts.
