                We propose HypeFL, a novel framework built on Hyperledger Fabric that combines blockchain and ML to create a 
                decentralized, collaborative, fully-connected autonomous vehicle system. HypeFL enables cooperative perception, 
                where vehicles fuse road perceptions to collaboratively perceive their environments and ensure optimal driving 
                decisions. Our system utilizes federated learning, a distributed ML approach, to optimize data privacy by only 
                sharing model parameters between vehicles, rather than raw data. The blockchain provides an immutable, decentralized 
                server that stores model parameters and vehicles as nodes, which provides protection against single-point failures, 
                eliminates the risk of malicious attacks, and emphasizes data privacy through a novel consensus protocol based on the 
                Multi-Krum algorithm. We tested HypeFL in real-world conditions using the online CARLA simulator, recording an average 
                object detection accuracy of 93.1% with a 35% decrease in collision rate compared to current approaches. We then 
                generalized HypeFL to a physical environment with miniature Raspberry Pi-powered cars, observing a 71.7% decrease in 
                collision rate.

                This research presents OtoScan, a revolutionary pipeline for the detection of middle ear infections using novel 
                ensemble networks for diagnosis and a custom 3D-printed mobile otoscope. The physical attachment was developed using 
                custom-designed 3D models, a compact magnification lens, fiber optics, and various electronics for illumination. To 
                develop detection algorithms, public otoscopic images were collected and augmented with realistic perturbations. An 
                ensemble of the InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and Xception architectures trained using transfer learning and label 
                smoothing was developed to mitigate class imbalance and overconfidence while improving diagnostic accuracy for acute 
                and chronic suppurative OM. Regions of interest are highlighted as gradient saliency maps in a smartphone application 
                using Grad-CAM++. Evaluation on public images shows that the proposed algorithm greatly surpasses standard and 
                state-of-the-art architectures such as a pretrained ResNet-50 in accuracy and F1 score. Further testing using an 
                industry-standard otoscopic simulator validated the real-world viability of this system.

                In this study, we introduce a novel architecture called LatentNet which automatically detects over-represented 
                features and reduces their weights during training. We tested our model on four distinct categories - three skin 
                color levels corresponding to Type I, II, and III on the Fitzpatrick Scale, and images containing visible hair. 
                Then, we compared the accuracy against the conventional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model trained using 
                the standard approach (i.e. without detecting over-represented features) and containing the same hyperparameters as 
                the LatentNet. The LatentNet showed significant performance improvement over the standard DCNN model with accuracy of 
                89.52%, 79.05%, 64.31%, and 64.35% compared to the DCNN accuracy of 90.41%, 70.82%, 45.28%, 56.52% in the corresponding 
                categories, respectively. Differences in the average performance between the models were statistically significant 
                (p < 0.05), suggesting that the proposed model successfully reduced bias amongst the tested categories.

                Over 1.3 million people are killed each year in road traffic crashes worldwide. Autonomous vehicles are
                the future of transportation. We devised an autonomous system for navigating highways using multi-agent
                reinforcement learning (MARL) using a shared intelligence system, allowing each agent (in this case the
                vehicles) to avoid collisions and efficiently move through traffic. We tested our algorithm first on a
                simulator, then generalized it to the real world where we trained our agent on varying parameters using
                a technique called active domain randomization.

                Current devices geared towards the deaf and hard of hearing, such as hearing aids, struggle to localize
                and transmit sounds to those with severe hearing impairments. Our goal was to convey the
                directionality, pitch, amplitude, sound classification, and speech recognition of multiple sound sources
                to those with hearing impairments through a low-cost device. We localized sounds with the SRP-PHAT-HSDA
                algorithm calculated on incoming audio captured by a 6-microphone array. We classified
                each source in real-time using a stacked generalization ensemble trained on an augmented audio dataset.

                to 579 million in only 3 decades. Current techniques to aid the visually disabled are expensive and
                limited in their ability, with limited and low accuracy computer vision. With ensemble learning we were
                able to get accuracies as high as 88% with four CV architectures trained on COCO and OIDv4. Furthermore,

                Cardiovascular disease (CD) is the number one leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for more than
                17 million deaths in 2015. Based on a simple interface and machine learning, HeartFit allows users to
                administer diagnoses themselves. The model consists of a deep recurrent convolutional neural network
                trained on 132 pre-labeled heartbeat audio samples. After the model was validated on a previously unseen
                set of 44 heartbeat audio samples, it achieved an f-beta score of 0.93 and an accuracy of 93.1%. This
                value exceeds that of clinical examination accuracy, which is around 83%, demonstrating the

                propose methods using kPCA, which outperforms current RX methods.
                In addition, he constructs an object-level analysis of anomaly detection performance, which is more

                Min explored a possible use of breast cancer classification models as a prediction tool in clinical

                outcome within 1, 2, 3, and 5 years after surgery, and creating a predictive application with Java. The
                SMO models classified tumor types with 98% accuracy and recurrence outcomes with 91%, 83%, 78%, and 69%
                accuracy within 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Lastly, a Java application implementing the SMO
                models was created to predict recurrence outcome for each year’s end with a specific data input.

                population.
                This project set out to create an inexpensive exoskeleton that a paralyzed patient could control with
                their brain, and they turned to machine learning to classify EEG signals.
                Using a Discrete Wavelength Transform to convert EEG signals into vectors, they then used a support
                vector machine to differentiate the EEG signals into two classes of motion.
                This allowed for a basic exoskeleton to allow for upperbody movement and body stabilization.

                Blindness related to diabetes, formally known as diabetic retinopathy, is a common condition in poor
                regions where difficult access to medical care prevents diagnosis.
                After this project, all you need to diagnose diabetic retinopathy is a smartphone, an inexpensive lens
                system, and a convolutional neural network trained on tens of thousands of images.
                Justin used Keras to create the deep learning model, taking advantage of the power of transfer learning
                with ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet.

                Detecting certain characteristics of writing related to style is very difficult using traditional
                methods.
                However, using machine learning, this project was able to associate authors with 72 different linguistic
                parameters characterizing writing style.
                They turned to Scikit-Learn for a quick and fast network which yielded impressive results.
                This apporach can be used as an improved way for preventing plagarism versus traditional methods.

            <p>Many extremists such as ISIS have used social media to recruit and influence thousands of potential
                jihadists and foreign fighters.
                TerroristTracker aims to stop this form of propaganda by turning the techniques these organizations use
                against them.
                By following specific symbols, such as the ISIS flag, using computer vision techniques and convolutional
                neural networks, a new system has been developed to track image features with 93.5% accuracy.
                These features, along with those extracted from caption analysis and user content, has allowed for
                classification with an SVM with 90.5% accuracy for identifying terrorist accounts.
